# Baselines

To help you get started with the challenge, we provide two official baseline implementations based on on the [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gMTaia--AB2) *"The IVI Lab entry to the GENEA Challenge 2022 â€“ A Tacotron2 Based Method for Co-Speech Gesture Generation With Locality-Constraint Attention Mechanism"*, kindly provided by [Che-jui Chang](https://sites.google.com/view/chejuichang/) from Rutgers University.

**You can find the two baseline models (one dyadic, and one monadic) in the following repository: https://github.com/genea-workshop/2023_ivi_baseline/**.
